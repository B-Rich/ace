1. INTRODUCTION

Sorry to tell you this, but I don't have enough time to put together a
tutorial for beginners at this time.  Maybe someone else can write about
this.

2. COMMON COMMANDS

There is one command that a lot of beginners have problems with: "cd".

The "cd" command changes the current working directory to whatever device/
directory you specify.  For example, if you were to enter the command:

cd a:

Then all filenames that you give on subsequent commands that do not include
a drive name as part of the pathnames of command arguments will be assumed
to be files on the "a:" drive (usually Commodore device #8).
